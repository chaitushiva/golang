Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the components in your Confluent Kafka deployment interact with each other, step-by-step:

1. Control Center
Talks to:
Kafka: To collect metrics, monitor performance, and manage topics, brokers, and consumer groups.
Schema Registry: For schema visibility and monitoring.
ksqlDB, Kafka Connect: For stream query visibility, connector management.
Purpose: UI-based monitoring, configuration, and diagnostics.
2. Kafka
Talks to:
Zookeeper: For broker coordination, topic configuration, partition leadership, etc.
Kafka Connect: To ingest or push data to external systems.
ksqlDB: To serve stream data for queries and transformations.
Schema Registry: For managing message schemas and ensuring compatibility.
Kafka REST Proxy: Allows HTTP-based Kafka interactions.
Purpose: Core messaging engine.
3. Zookeeper
Talks to:
Kafka: As a coordination service to keep track of brokers, partitions, and leader election.
Connect, ksqlDB: May interact for configuration or cluster coordination.
Purpose: Centralized coordination (required by Kafka for older versions).
4. Kafka Connect
Talks to:
Kafka: To read/write data from/to topics.
Zookeeper: For distributed worker coordination.
Purpose: Acts as a data pipeline to external systems (DBs, S3, etc).
5. ksqlDB
Talks to:
Kafka: For consuming streams, performing queries, and publishing results.
Zookeeper: For internal state and metadata.
Purpose: Stream processing engine using SQL-like syntax.
6. Schema Registry
Talks to:
Kafka: For storing schema versions.
Kafka REST Proxy & Control Center: Provides schema compatibility and validation.
Purpose: Ensures data schema evolution is safe across producers and consumers.
7. Kafka REST Proxy
Talks to:
Kafka: To produce and consume messages via HTTP.
Schema Registry: To serialize/deserialize messages.
Purpose: Makes Kafka accessible to REST-based clients.
