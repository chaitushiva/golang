With IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) via OIDC, the session tagging process was handled implicitly, while with EKS Pod Identity, AWS requires explicit session tagging via sts:TagSession.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how IRSA and Pod Identity differ in role assumption:

How IRSA (OIDC) Handled This
IAM Role Assumption via OIDC:
IRSA used a federated trust relationship with the EKS OIDC provider.
The IAM role trust policy allowed the OIDC provider (sts.amazonaws.com) to issue credentials based on the service account annotation.
OIDC Provided Tags Automatically:
AWS automatically injected the kubernetes.io/serviceaccount and kubernetes.io/cluster tags when the pod assumed the IAM role.
The role trust policy validated these tags without requiring an explicit sts:TagSession.
Result:
The IAM role assumption happened smoothly because the session was tagged implicitly without needing sts:TagSession.
How EKS Pod Identity Works Differently
IAM Role Assumption via Pod Identity Agent:
With EKS Pod Identity, the role assumption happens through the Pod Identity agent instead of OIDC.
This agent calls sts:AssumeRole but now requires sts:TagSession explicitly.
Explicit Tagging Required:
AWS now mandates that the session be tagged with kubernetes.io/serviceaccount and kubernetes.io/cluster.
The IAM role in Account B must allow sts:TagSession to let the role be assumed successfully.
Result:
If sts:TagSession is missing, the role assumption fails with a permission error.
Why Did AWS Change This?
EKS Pod Identity is fully managed and more scalable than IRSA.
Pod Identity uses session tags explicitly, requiring permissions that IRSA handled implicitly.
AWS enforces stricter role assumptions to ensure security by requiring explicit permission for tagging sessions.
Key Takeaways
Feature	IRSA (OIDC)	EKS Pod Identity
Role Assumption	Via OIDC provider	Via Pod Identity Agent
Session Tagging	Implicitly added	Explicitly requires sts:TagSession
Trust Policy	Allowed sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity	Requires sts:AssumeRole with tag conditions
Permission Requirement	No need for sts:TagSession	Needs sts:TagSession
Since EKS Pod Identity now enforces explicit session tagging, updating the IAM role trust policy and permissions is necessary to allow ExternalDNS to assume the role successfully.
